This tool was developed by DubstepDragon for use with IronicSoap's Models

It's a slimmed down open sourced toolset from this asset  https://booth.pm/en/items/2207020 

that I have since reworked on my own. 

the AwboiMerger and the AwboiUnmerger are a fully featured toolset designed for ShadetheBat's Awtter and that code is not associated with this tool.
