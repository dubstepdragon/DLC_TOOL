# DLC_TOOL

This is a stripped down version of my core tools that I use for the AwboiMerger for ShadeTheBat's [AwtterMerger](https://github.com/dubstepdragon/AwtterMerger) tool.

The code base this is built on is from an asset https://booth.pm/en/items/2207020

These tools are for use building quick dlc for VRchat and are a "DESTRUCTIVE" merge, meaning your avatar will be modified when you hit merge and not during the build process. 

If you want a more fully featured, more compatible tool please go check out [VRCFury](https://vrcfury.com/). It's an amazing tool and I highly recommend it.
